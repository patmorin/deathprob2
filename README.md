Compute your probability of dying within the next year

This can be a useful tool for decision-making or understanding risk.  Some examples:

- How much would a covid infection increase your chances of dying this year?
- How much would an organ donation increase your risk of dying this year?

Warning: The answers obtained from this program may cause anxiety.  Many people usually underestimate their risk of dying by at least an order of magnitude.  For example, a typical 48-year old Ontario male has a 1/392 chance of dying in the next year.
